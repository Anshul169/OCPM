# OCPM Project

Welcome! In this project, our primary aim is to uncover and leverage the relationships between different types of objects within object-centric event logs (OCEL), that can be further used to optimize process models and make them simpler.

---

## **Key Features**
- Created a multi-factor scoring model (O2O, shared activities, co-occurrence, temporal proximity) to quantify object relationships
in object centric process mining.
- Designed graph-based visualizations to map and analyze interactions between object types.
- Classified relationship strengths (strong/moderate/weak) to prioritize critical process dependencies.
- Enabled object-type clustering to simplify complex process models and identify functional groups.

## **Getting Started**

To get started with the project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the respective `README.md` files for running the code and generating clusters.
- Download the file Clustering_code.ipynb and open it in suitable editor(Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook).
- Download the Sample datasets and upload them to Google drive.
- Start running the code, block by block.
